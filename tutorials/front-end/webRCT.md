# WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables direct peer-to-peer communication between web browsers and mobile applications. It is primarily used for real-time audio, video, and data transfer. This article will cover the basics of WebRTC, its main features, and how you can set up a basic WebRTC application.

## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is an open-source project that allows browsers to exchange real-time media and data streams directly without the need for plugins or third-party software. It was designed by Google and is supported by most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

By enabling peer-to-peer communication, WebRTC reduces latency and improves performance for applications such as video conferencing, voice calls, and data sharing.

## Key Features of WebRTC

### Peer-to-Peer Communication

WebRTC allows direct communication between browsers, bypassing centralized servers for media exchange. This results in lower latency and reduces the reliance on intermediary servers for routing audio and video.

### Secure Communication

WebRTC supports secure communication by default. It uses encryption mechanisms such as DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for data channels and SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol) for media streams, ensuring a secure exchange of data.

### Built-in Media Support

WebRTC provides native support for handling audio and video streams, making it easy for developers to build video conferencing or audio calling applications. The API includes methods to capture media from cameras and microphones, as well as to transmit media between peers.

```javascript
navigator.mediaDevices
  .getUserMedia({ video: true, audio: true })
  .then((stream) => {
    // Attach the stream to a video element
    document.querySelector("video").srcObject = stream;
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error("Error accessing media devices.", error));
```
